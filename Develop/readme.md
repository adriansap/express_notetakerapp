# Express Note Taker App

## Description

This app is designed for the on-the-move person who needs a fast way to log ideas. The app saves notes to a database file of JSON format. Notes can easily be retrieved from the side bar. The app runs off a server utilizing express.js.

## Table Of Contents
## Installation

To install the server.js must be running off node. 

## Usage

To use the app, open notes.html. You can type a note and it's title then click on the floppy disk icon to save the note. Notes then appear on the left side bar, to retrieve them simply click on the desired note.

## Licensing

Open-ware.

## Questions

When trying to load the CSS file and index.js into notes.html, there were issues, so the source code was inserted directly into the notes.html file, which led to successful loading. Would like to know reasons for trouble with loading these files seperately. Note - the files would load when running off the hard-drive, they wouldn't load when trying off localhost.

## Contributing
